Input files for APACE can be specified in one of 4 general formats:

1. String, the name of a text file of filepaths to nifti OR cifti
   images, one filepath per row. Each image file consists of all of
   the data for that subject.

2. Cell array, one element per subject, where each element is a
   string, a file path to a nifti OR cifti image. Each image file
   consists of all the data for that subject.

3. Cell array of _length_ _1_, where the single element is a string,
   the filepath to a  multi-subject nifti OR cifti image
   (e.g. {'AllMySubjects.nii'} or {'AllMySubjects.dtseries.nii'). For 
   either, the final dimension is equal to the number of sujbects. For 
   example, for 120 subjects, it could be a 2D image, 3000 x 120, or a
   3D image, 3000 x 2 x 120, or a 4D image, 91 x 109 x 91 x 120.

4. A real matrix variable, where the final dimension is equal to the
   number of subjects. 


MASKING OPTIONS
    --- Mask must be in the same format as the subject data*

1. Image mask specified as a string, a filepath to a mask image.  (Can
   be omitted.)

* Exception:  CIFTI file images can be masked with an in-memory matrix.


"CONTRAST" SELECTION
    --- ONLY AVAILABLE for:
      a. A list of 4D NIFTI images, one 4D image per subject, 1 3D
         volume per contrast.
      b. A list of CIFTI images, one image per subject, where the last
         dimension indexes contrasts.

1. A scalar will select out the volume or dimension that corresponds
to the "contrast" of interest.

Note: Masking is permitted, but must match the dimensions after
seleciton.  I.e. for NIFTI the mask must be a 3D image of the same
dimensions.
